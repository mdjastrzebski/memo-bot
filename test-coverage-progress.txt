test(input-screen): User can enter words and start game
- Coverage: input-screen.tsx 0% → 100% (all statements, branches, functions, lines)
- Overall: 2.44% → 10.01% statements
- Tested: word input parsing, default words fallback, prompt parsing with pipe separator
- Used real Zustand store (not mocked) to test actual integration
- Learned: words are shuffled in startGame, so tests check presence not order
